# KADW's Image Converter

With this, you can turn boring images into interesting-looking gifs very quickly! It works faster than [Photomosh](https://photomosh.com/) (once you have everything set up) and can be used to process images in bulk.

### [Access on Google Colab here! No coding required.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F6kmh7cTbt8EFPReww8BVQ3F0f0zcbSb?usp=sharing)

### If You Want To Clone and Run Directly (Without Colab):

Run converter.py. All relevant information is there.

You may need to install some things. gifsicle and imageMagick (convert) are required to work on the command line for the gif functions.

Not heavily tested. Works on Linux.

The Colab linked above also comes with a description of most of the functions included in converter.py (scroll to the bottom), which is slightly more detailed than the in-code comments, if you would find that useful.
